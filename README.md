This repository contains the collab file for our project. It is divided into 2 sections with multiple code blocks:

## Preparation and Model Training
- Import Packages: Import Packages used like numpy, pandas, and sklearn
- Load and Partition Data: Load data from github and save into a dataframe the explanatory variables we are training on
- One-Hot-Encode categorical data
- Clean data and split into test and traing: Used an 80-20 training-testing data split
- Fit a model
- Calculate MSE

## Streamlit 
- Build and run the streamlit model : This is done in 3 code blocks, one to house the streamlit code, one to inditalize the streamlit model, and one to build the application
